## I built my career on a lie 
You see, I launched myself with the precarious accelerant of an Ivy League *Artium Baccalaurei* double-major . In one hand, *Computer Science*, and in the other, *Literature and Creative Writing*. Had I been seeing a therapist as I should have back then, they might have warned me that such a wanton display of indecision posed genuine questions about my mental health. But who needs therapy when you have code and poetry?

The truth is, I don't regret choosing both majors. They have taught me valuable lessons and opened up new possibilities for me. I love being able to switch between different modes of thinking and expression. I love being able to combine my passions and create something unique and original. I love being able to appreciate both the beauty and the functionality of language and technology. And most of all, I love being able to share my experiences and insights with you, my dear readers. So thank you for following me on this journey of discovery and self-acceptance.
